## Overview
This project is aimed at exploring weather datasets and building a robust machine learning model to predict weather conditions. The workflow starts with data preprocessing and cleaning, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and seasonal patterns. A machine learning pipeline is then constructed to train and evaluate predictive models. To boost performance, hyperparameters are fine-tuned using the OPTUNA optimization framework, and data augmentation techniques are applied to further improve the robustness of the model. The entire process is documented in the (`WeatherDataAnalysis.ipynb`) notebook.

## Data
The project uses historical weather data containing features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. The data is initially cleaned to remove inconsistencies and missing values. Data types are standardized, and any anomalies or outliers are filtered out to ensure a reliable foundation for analysis and modeling. The data preparation stage is critical, as it forms the basis for both the EDA and the model training processes.

## Analysis
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) section of the notebook covers:

Data Cleaning: Addressing missing values, handling data type conversions, and normalizing the dataset.
Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing key features through mean, median, standard deviation, and distribution plots.
Visualizations: Creating time series plots, histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to explore the relationships among different weather parameters.
Insights: Highlighting trends such as seasonal variations, weather extremes, and correlations that could influence predictive performance.
These steps help in understanding the data’s characteristics and guide feature engineering for the machine learning model.



## Machine Learning Model
This section describes the construction and training of the predictive model. Key points include:

Feature Engineering: Enhancing the dataset by creating new features (e.g., rolling averages, lag features) that may better capture underlying patterns.
Model Selection: Evaluating different algorithms to determine the best fit for forecasting weather conditions.
Training Process: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, training the model, and using performance metrics (accuracy, RMSE, etc.) to evaluate its performance.
Evaluation: Using Random Forest Classifier Algorithm an accuracy of 88.3% is achieved.

## Fine Tuning using OPTUNA
To further optimize the model's performance, hyperparameter tuning is performed using the OPTUNA framework. This section of the notebook covers:

OPTUNA Integration: How the OPTUNA library is set up to perform hyperparameter optimization.
Objective Function: Definition of the objective function that guides the tuning process.
Search Process: A description of how different parameter combinations are tested iteratively.
Best Parameters: The final chosen set of hyperparameters that yield the best performance on validation data.
Performance Improvement: Discussion on how fine tuning improved model accuracy and robustness.

## Data Augmentation
In scenarios where the available dataset is limited, data augmentation techniques are applied to artificially expand the dataset. This section includes:

Techniques Used: Methods such as synthetic sample generation, noise injection, and time series augmentation strategies.
Implementation: How augmentation is applied to the weather dataset to create additional training samples.
Impact: Evaluation of how the augmented data helps in reducing overfitting and improving the model’s generalization on unseen data.
Evaluation: After Data Augmentation, an accuracy of 99% was achieved using the best parameters of Random Forest Classifier specified from Optunas hyperparameter tuning.

## Results
The results section summarizes the key findings from both the EDA and the machine learning model:

Visualization of Outcomes: Graphs and charts that compare model predictions against actual weather events.
Performance Metrics: Detailed metrics (e.g., accuracy, RMSE, MAE) that quantify the performance of the model before and after fine tuning.
Insights and Learnings: Discussion on which features and tuning strategies contributed most significantly to the predictive power of the model.
Future Improvements: Suggestions on potential avenues for further refining the model and enhancing data quality.
